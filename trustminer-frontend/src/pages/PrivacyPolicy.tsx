                    Data privacy is important to us. This means that we process data about identified or identifiable
                    individuals, which is called personal data, with due care and in accordance with applicable data
                    protection law.
                    <br/>This Privacy Notice describes how we process personal data we collect from individuals in
                    relation to their use of our Application and the measures we take to assist the users of our
                    Application to comply with data protection law that applies to them. In legal terms, we are the data
                    controller, as we determine the means and/or purposes of the processing.
                    <br/>This Privacy Notice only covers data processing carried out by Trust Studio. The Privacy Notice
                    does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy practices of any third parties.
                    <br/><br/><Box fontWeight="fontWeightBold">2. Data Collection</Box>
                    Users have the possibility to either use the application in free form or in a controlled user study.
                    The personal data we collect from individuals using our Service and Application (“Users”) consists
                    of user data limited to the session ID. In the research study users can voluntarily provide
                    demographic information such as their knowledge with BPM, age, gender and mother tongue. We do not
                    collect any names, e-mail address, home address or phone numbers. Consequently, our Users do not
                    need to create user profiles in order to be able to use our Application. We track the user’s
                    behavior on the website. Therefore, we collect timestamped events of user interactions with Trust
                    Studio and the controlled user study. The survey part in the study utilizes Google forms (see <Link
                    color="secondary" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">policies.google.com/privacy</Link> for
                    privacy). Further, we use Google Analytics, an analytics service provided by Google, Inc.
                    (“Google”). The information generated about your use of the Application (including your IP address)
                    will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. On behalf of the
                    Technische Universität Berlin, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your
                    use of the Application, compiling reports on Application usage activity and providing other services
                    relating to Application activity. You can refuse the use of Google Analytics within the Application.
                    However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the
                    Application.
                    <br/>For further information concerning the terms and conditions of use and data privacy at Google

                    <br/><br/><Box fontWeight="fontWeightBold">3. Purposes</Box>
                    We process your personal data for the following purposes:
                    <br/>• for scientific research,
                    <br/>• to collect responses from users in order to meet the purpose of the Service,
                    <br/>• to perform tracking of the use of our Application.
                    <br/>In consideration of the collection and processing for the purposes listed above, Trust Studio
                    is supported by the Technische Universität Berlin acting as data controllers.
                    <br/><br/><Box fontWeight="fontWeightBold">4. Storage Period</Box>
                    We store your personal data in accordance with the Statute on the Safeguarding of Good Academic
                    Practice at Technische Universität Berlin for no longer than 10 years for research purposes.
                    <br/>We erase personal data after the above described storage period or when the User requests us to
                    erase his/her personal data.
                    <br/><br/><Box fontWeight="fontWeightBold">5. Legitimate Grounds for Processing</Box>
                    We process your personal data to pursue our legitimate interest for research purposes only within
                    the research group of Technische Universität Berlin. The collected data is not used for commercial
                    purposes.
                    <br/><br/><Box fontWeight="fontWeightBold">6. Rights of Users</Box>
                    Right to access: Any User may contact us to get confirmation as to whether or not we are processing
                    User’s personal data. Where we do process User’s personal data, we will inform User of what
                    categories of personal data we process regarding him/her, the processing purposes, the categories of
                    recipients to whom personal data have been or will be disclosed and the envisaged storage period or
                    criteria to determine that period.
                    <br/>Right to withdraw consent: In case our processing is based on a consent granted by the User,
                    the User may withdraw the consent at any time by contacting us or by using the functionalities of
                    our Services. Withdrawing a consent may lead to fewer possibilities to use our Services.
                    <br/>Right to rectification: Any User has the right to have inaccurate or incomplete personal data
                    we store about the User rectified or completed.
                    <br/>Right to object: Any User has the right to object to our processing at any time, even if our
                    processing is based on our legitimate interest in the operation, maintenance and further development
                    of our Services. We shall then no longer process User’s personal data unless for the provision of
                    our Services or if we demonstrate other compelling legitimate grounds for our processing that
                    override User’s interests, rights and freedoms or for legal claims.
                    <br/>Right to restriction of processing: Any User has the right to obtain from us restriction of
                    processing of User’s personal data, as foreseen by applicable data protection law, e.g. to allow our
                    verification of accuracy of personal data after User’s contesting of accuracy or to prevent us from
                    erasing personal data when personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes but still required
                    for User’s legal claims or when our processing is unlawful. Restriction of processing may lead to
                    fewer possibilities to use our Services.
                    <br/>Right to data portability: Any User has the right to receive User’s personal data from us in a
                    structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to independently transmit those data to a
                    third party, in case our processing is based on User’s consent and carried out by automated means.
                    <br/>Right to erasure: Any User has the right to have personal data we process about the User erased
                    from our systems if the personal data are no longer necessary for the related purposes, or if we
                    have unlawfully processed the personal data. Any User furthermore has the right to erasure if the
                    User withdraws consent or objects to our processing as meant above, unless we have a legitimate
                    ground to not erase the data. We may not immediately be able to erase all residual copies from our
                    servers and backup systems after the active data have been erased. Such copies shall be erased as
                    soon as reasonably possible.
                    <br/>How to use these rights: To exercise any of the above mentioned rights, User should primarily
                    use the functions offered by our Services. If such functions are however not sufficient for
                    exercising such rights, Customer shall send us a letter or email to the address set out below under
                    Contact, including the following information: device ID. We may request additional information
                    necessary to confirm User’s identity. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive,
                    excessive or manifestly unfounded.
                    <br/><br/><Box fontWeight="fontWeightBold">7. Security</Box>
                    We implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational security measures
                    to protect the personal data we process, from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, loss or
                    destruction. Access to the user data is only available to Technische Universität Berlin employees
                    within the group, and only to those who have been granted access explicitly.
                    <br/>Should despite of our security measures, a security breach occur that is likely to result in a
                    risk to the data privacy of Users, we will inform the relevant Users and other affected parties, as
                    well as relevant authorities when required by applicable data protection law, about the security
                    breach as soon as reasonably possible.
                    <br/><br/><Box fontWeight="fontWeightBold">8. Recipients</Box>

                    <br/>For legal reasons. We may share your personal data with third parties only if we have
                    good-faith belief that their access to and use of the personal data is necessary (i) to meet any
                    applicable law and/or court order, (ii) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or
                    technical issues, and/or (iii) to protect the interests, properties or safety of us, our Users or

                    withdraw this consent at any time.
